This repository contains my CV in both PDF and LaTeX formats. 
Feel free to use or modify these templates as needed for your own CV. 
The LaTeX files are easily customizable, allowing you to adjust the layout and content to suit your style. 
Whether you're starting from scratch or just need a clean template to work with, these files provide a solid foundation for creating a professional-looking CV.

Additionally, you can easily link between the English and Turkish versions of the CV by using the similar structure I have used with PDF links.
